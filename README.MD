# Project Description
- This project's goal to build a Flask Application

The goal of this project is to create a flask application that is based on the tutorial https://hackersandslackers.com/your-first-flask-application/. There are folders that contain different parts of the tutorial. This project is continued from IS_601_Project03 (https://github.com/clairenjit369/IS_601_Project03.git).

- Use any Terminal (Windows, Mac, etc.) to start the project
- Clone the GitHub repo to PyCharm program and change into the project directory
- Run the command "docker-compose build" without the quotation marks. Wait until the services finish building.
- Once it is done, run the command "docker-compose up" to bring up the services. 
- Open any web browser, and enter localhost:5000. This will open the project, and you'll be able to view it. 
- When you are done, run "docker-compose down". This will stop all the containers and remove the images.
